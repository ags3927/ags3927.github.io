My research focuses on developing novel algorithms and models that use multi-omics data to facilitate clinical decision-making. I have a strong background in machine learning, and computer vision, and I am passionate about applying these technologies to solve medically relevant problems. I am also an avid musician trained in Indian classical music as a vocalist. In my spare time I enjoy reading high fantasy novels and playing video games. My current reading list mostly consists of Brandon Sanderson's works and Mistborn is my favorite book series. I am a former Dota 2 player (read addict) and have over 9000 hours of playtime (not something I am proud of).","location":{"address":"51 Joline Road","postalCode":"NY 11776","city":"Port Jefferson Station","countryCode":"US","region":"New York"},"profiles":[{"network":"LinkedIn","username":"gangulyaniruddha","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gangulyaniruddha"}]},"work":[{"name":"Stony Brook University","position":"Research Assistant","url":"","startDate":"2024-01-01","endDate":"Present","summary":"Graph Neural Networks and efficient graph construction for gene expression prediction from histopathology images in Spatial Transcriptomics (ST).

By clustering tissue image patches based on both spatial and morphological features, and incorporating intra- and inter-cluster edges, our approach fosters interactions between distant tissue locations during GNN learning. As an additional contribution, we evaluate different data smoothing techniques that are necessary to mitigate artifacts in ST data, often caused by technical imperfections and advocate for adopting gene-aware smoothing methods that are more biologically justified."}],"skills":[{"name":"Physics","level":"Master","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["Quantum Mechanics","Quantum Computing","Quantum Information","Quantum Cryptography","Quantum Communication","Quantum Teleportation"]}],"languages":[{"language":"German","fluency":"Native speaker","icon":""},{"language":"English","fluency":"Fluent","icon":""}],"interests":[{"name":"Physics","icon":"fa-solid fa-tag","keywords":["Quantum Mechanics","Quantum Computing","Quantum Information","Quantum Cryptography","Quantum Communication","Quantum Teleportation"]}],"references":[{"name":"Professor John Doe","icon":"fa-solid fa-laptop","reference":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
